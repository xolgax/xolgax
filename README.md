## 👋 Hello, 
My name is Paul Krauss,
I've been working in information technology for over 30 years. I started as a developer and moved into system administration. In my journey, I have supported Novell Netware, Windows, Solaris, Aix, and Linux. I have spent the most time with Solaris and Linux. I became a full-time Linux administrator in 2010 after Oracle purchased Sun Microsystems. I'm now in the process of moving to DevOps.  
  
I started programming in GW-Basic in the early 90's then move to C and assembly. I currently code in TCL/Expect, BASH shell, Java, Perl, Python, and C#.  
  
I have multiple industry certifications: 
- CISSP 
- RHCE 5, 6, 7 
- ITIL 3 
- I have Multiple Certificates of expertise from Red Hat, including Cluster, Satellite, and RHV.  
- Solaris 8 and 10   

    
## 👀 I'm interested in ...
I am learning as much as I can about DevOps, AWS, and Azure. Outside of information technology, I play ice hockey, do Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu, and play chess.

## 🌱 I'm currently learning ...
Ansible, Puppet, Terraform, CloudFormation, Python, C#, Javascript, PowerCLI, AWS, and Azure.

## 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on ...
Anything that will help me learn coding better in Python, C#, Java, or Javascript.
